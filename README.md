  <b>Helm</b> is an Emacs framework for incremental completions and narrowing
  selections. It provides an easy-to-use API for developers wishing to build
  their own Helm applications in Emacs, powerful search tools and dozens of
  already built-in commands providing completion to almost everything.
  It is a must-have for anyone using Emacs as a main work environment.
  Helm has been widely adopted by many Emacs power-users.
  It is available in Melpa and can be easily installed from the Emacs package manager.
