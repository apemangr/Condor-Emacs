  <b>Condor Emacs</b> is an option to take the Emacs experience just out of the box, designed for the newbie and the expert.
 At this time, this version is only focused to be a C and C++ languages IDE. But very soon will have support for more languages.
  For the moment this is just a beta, any help with this project is welcome.
